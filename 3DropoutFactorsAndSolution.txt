One of the first worrying factors would be a student showing a lack of interest and/or communication regarding the work
this includes lack of effort through his work, negative attitude or signs of hopelessness towards his work. Giving solutions 
that are either copied from the internet without trying to understand or not even attempting the questions or tasks, 
consistently slow task completion.

To ease this process as a mentor and ensure a pass, I do have the ability to make the tasks or questions course more approachable
and understandable, I can present the question in a different manner and apply different teaching techniques for the specific learning curves 
to prevent frustration and apathy towards questions he finds too hard.  I can also encourage him to get it done and 
provide alternative examples he can learn off of and apply to his own solutions.

Maintaing contact and motivation for the student will be vital to kepeing him on track to finishing and passing his course, making
solutions understandable and giving a strong explanaton or demonstration on applying concepts he may struggle with.
