Hi There,

I'm having a bit of an issue with trying to figure out how to exactly implement the class methods so that I may call
 them outside of the class when trying to create a new SMS object.

Thanks!

==========================================

Hi there,

To access class methods outside of the class you can access them by instantiating a clas onto the object, as you have done for no_1. You are then able to access these methods using .
for example objectSMS.add_sms() I will indicate in your code where and alternative options to accessing the class methods.

If you are having trouble regarding functionality I will make pointers to where the syntax can be better structured. Feel free to send me a message if you need further clairification or questions.
