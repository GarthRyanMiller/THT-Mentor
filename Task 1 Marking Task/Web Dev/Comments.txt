Hi There,

I currently a moveable character on a webpage but I want prevent it from going out of the screen's bounds.
Please could you give me an idea and some basic code on how to approach this problem?

Thanks!

You had the correct solution but it seems you are checking if there is space after a key is pressed and not if the new position after the key is pressed is < 0.
